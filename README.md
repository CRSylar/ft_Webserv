# ft_Webserv
A webserv in c++ for the 42 school project 

[![cromalde's 42 webserv Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cl1z1axw3001109mox1m22pjp/project/2182608)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)

Project done with @UmbertoSavoia.

In this project we have to write a Webserver in c++ inspired by Nginx.
As Nginx you can configure one or more Server block, different location, method allowed, index & error page, and call the CGI to resolve any kind of non .html file ( you have to set the path to the correct CGI in the config file ).

See the Subject for more information about what we need to do.
